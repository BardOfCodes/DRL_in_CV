    We will look at three Computer Vision tasks, namely-
        Object Detection
        Action Detection
        Visual Tracking

    For each task we will try answering these questions -
        What is the task?
        Can we identify the RL components -
            The MDP formulation
                State Space
                Action Space
                Reward System
            Network Architecture
        Why use RL for this task?


1) **We will look at the following tasks:**
	* Object Detection
		* Paper: Caicedo, Juan C., and Svetlana Lazebnik. "Active object localization with deep reinforcement learning." Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. 2015.
	* Action Detection
		* Paper: Huang, Jingjia, et al. "A Self-Adaptive Proposal Model for Temporal Action Detection based on Reinforcement Learning." arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.07251 (2017).
	* Visual Tracking
		* Paper: Yoo, Sangdoo Yun1 Jongwon Choi1 Youngjoon, Kimin Yun, and Jin Young Choi. "Action-Decision Networks for Visual Tracking with Deep Reinforcement Learning".

2) **For each Task we answer these:**
	* What is the task?
	* Can we identify the RL components:
		* State Space
		* Action Space
		* Reward System
	* Network Architecture
	* Why use RL for this Tasks
