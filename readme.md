# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision

**[Google Slides on this introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nnt6Jj77SLECbeb3m_Y6lqDEH0t8CUePJt2U-HlT6ZM/edit?usp=sharing)**

In recent years, while use of Computer Vision techniques/models has burgeoned
for solving Reinforcement Learning task(such as games), the opposite flow, of
using techinques/models from Reinforcement Learning to solve paradigms in
Computer Vision has also been seen.

Additionally, from a few stalwarts of Computer Vision:

This indicates that just as researchers in Reinforcement learning benifited from
understanding and applying Computer vision techniques, researchers in
Computer Vision can benifit from not treating Reinforcement learning as an esoteric
black box and gaining a comprehensive understanding of this subject.

Hence, we are presenting a short series of lectures,(at our lab) with the following motivation:

## Content for each Topic

We have roughly 12 major topics, and each topic contains:

* A reaveal.js based presentation on the topic, and

* A Tutorial on the topic in a Jupyter-Notebook(with solutions)
