GitHub Pages uses a Markdown engine called <dfn>kramdown</dfn> for formatting text posts. kramdown is a superset of Markdown, meaning:

1. anything thatâ€™s valid Markdown is also valid kramdown, and
2. it provides and strictly specifies a number of features that are not available in Markdown.[^1] 

Consult the official [kramdown syntax reference][kds] for an exhaustive list of features and how to use them.
